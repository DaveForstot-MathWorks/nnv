# Local Testing for VNN-COMP Scripts


# Preparing for 2025 competition

TODO:

- Choose optimal reachability options for each benchmark.

- Change to the new ONNX import function (ImportNetworkFromONNX)

- Create a load_models file and a simple reachability script for each benchmakrs
    - Document errors, add notes on reachability, include proposed solutions

- Test the python integration with newest MATLAB version. Can we simplify the code and reduce computation time using the matlab engine for python? (This did not work properly on 2023a, We'll try on 2024a/b this year.)
