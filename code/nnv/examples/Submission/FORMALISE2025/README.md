# (Artifact) Robustness Verification of Video Classification Neural Networks

This artifact is used to reproduce the results in _Robustness Verification of Video Classification Neural Networks_.

All results from _Robustness Verification of Video Classification Neural Networks_ were captured using an Apple M1 Max 10-core CPU@3.20GHz√ó10 with 64GB of RAM. The times reported to run the smoke test and reproduce results are approximated based on this computer.

# Requirements

The following resources are required to run this artifact:

- MATLAB 2024a with NNV and npy-matlab installed and added to the path.
- conda environment with Python v3.11. Install rquirements from requirements.txt. Make sure to install the source files.

# Installation

1. Clone NNV and npy-matlab and install them ensuring that both have been added to the MATLAB path.

```
# Clone NNV and npy-matlab
git clone --recursive https://github.com/verivital/nnv.git
git clone https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab.git
```

Follow the instructions under heading `# Installation:` on [NNV's README](https://github.com/verivital/nnv/blob/master/README.md). Note, if using a computer with an Apple silicon CPU, then it may be necessary to remove a line from NNV's `install.m` script. The following line

```matlab
tbxmanager install lcp hysdel cddmex clpmex glpkmex fourier sedumi;
```

can be removed/commented out.

For `npy-matlab`, add and save the path to MATLAB. Again, instructions are available on [`npy-matlab`'s README](https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab/blob/master/README.md).

2. Download the following dataset files from here into the `FORMALISE2025/data` folder:

-

3. Create a conda environment with `Python v3.11` and install the requirements from `requirements.txt`. Additionally, install the source files to the environment. Both can be done by running the following commands from the root directory (`FORMALISE2025`):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # before installing source files, make sure to navigate to this src directory, e.g.
   cd /path/to/FORMALISE2025/src
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. Modify the `verify.py` file to add the path to your NNV and npy-matlab directories (the repositories that were cloned earlier). For the `npy-matlab` repository, you'll want to reference the subfolder in the directory also called `npy-matlab`, e.g. `/some/path/to/npy-matlab/npy-matlab`.

# Smoke Test Instructions (~30 minutes)

Instructions to quickly test the software needed to reproduce the artifacts of the paper. If no issues arise during the smoke test, you can safely proceed to reproducing all artifacts as described in the below section.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `FORMALISE2025` directory.
2. Make sure the conda environment with the installed dependencies is activated.
3. Run the following command to enable the smoke test script to be executed and then run it:

```bash
chmod +x run_smoketest.sh && ./run_smoketest.sh
```

4. The smoketest will verify a single sample from each of the different datasets and with the different verification algorithms. The results will be output to a `smoketest_outputs.txt` file. Assuming everything ran smoothly, you should see:

```
**********************************************
              Smoke test complete.
**********************************************
```

# Reproducing the Full Results

Assuming the average runtime for the experiments remains as shown in the paper, then it will take approximately 9-10 days to reproduce the results. As such, there will also be an intermediary where we verify 1/10 samples verified in the full experiments. Those instructions will be in the next section. For now, we discuss how to reproduce the full results. The instructions will be the exact same for running the smoke test, only we use a different script.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `FORMALISE2025` directory.
2. Make sure the conda environment with the installed dependencies is activated.
3. Run the following command to begin reproducing the artifacts:

```bash
chmod +x run_vvn.sh && ./run_vvn.sh
```

# Reproducing a Subset of the Results

This set of instructions is for reproducing a subset of the results. In this case, we verify every tenth sample from what was done for the original verification. Generating the reachable output range plots remains the same.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `FORMALISE2025` directory.
2. Make sure the conda environment with the installed dependencies is activated.
3. Run the following command to begin reproducing a subset of the artifacts:

```bash
chmod +x run_subset_vvn.sh && run_subset_vvn.sh
```
