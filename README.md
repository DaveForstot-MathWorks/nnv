# NNV
Matlab Toolbox for Neural Network Verification

This toolbox implements reachability methods for analyzing neural networks and control systems with neural network controllers in the area of autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPS).

## Related tools and software

This toolbox makes use of the neural network model transformation tool ([nnmt](https://github.com/verivital/nnmt)) and for closed-loop systems analysis, the hybrid systems model transformation and translation tool ([HyST](https://github.com/verivital/hyst)), and the COntinuous Reachability Analyzer ([CORA](https://github.com/TUMcps/CORA)).

## Execution without installation:
NNV can be executed online without installing Matlab or other dependencies through [CodeOcean](https://www.codeocean.com) via the following CodeOcean capsules:

_Latest_
* CAV 2023 Tool Paper: https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.0803700.v1
  
_Previous_
* CAV 2020 ImageStar paper version: https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.3351375.v1
* CAV 2020 Tool paper version: https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.0221760.v1
* Earliest version: https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.1314285.v1

# Installation:
    
1. Install MATLAB (2022b or newer) with at least the following toolboxes:
   * Computer Vision
   * Control Systems
   * Deep Learning
   * Image Processing
   * Optimization
   * Parallel Computing
   * Statistics and Machine Learning
   * Symbolic Math
   * System Identification
   
2. Install the following support package
       [Deep Learning Toolbox Converter for ONNX Model Format](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/67296-deep-learning-toolbox-converter-for-onnx-model-format)
       
       Note: Support packages can be installed in MATLAB's HOME tab > Add-Ons > Get Add-ons, search for the support package using the Add-on Explorer and click on the Install button.

3. Clone or download the NNV toolbox from (https://github.com/verivital/nnv)
    
    Note: to operate correctly, nnv depends on other tools (CORA, NNMT, HyST, onnx2nnv), which are included as git submodules. As such, you must clone recursively, e.g., with the following:
    
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/verivital/nnv.git

4. Open MATLAB, then go to the directory where NNV exists on your machine, then run the `install.m` script located at /nnv/
    
    Note: if you restart Matlab, rerun either install.m or startup_nnv.m, which will add the necessary dependencies to the path; you alternatively can run `savepath` after installation to avoid this step after restarting Matlab, but this may require administrative privileges

5. Optional installation packages

   a. To run verification for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on VGG16/VGG19, additional support packages must be installed:

   * [VGG16](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/61733-deep-learning-toolbox-model-for-vgg-16-network)

   * [VGG19](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/vgg19.html)
       
    b) To run MATLAB's neural network verification comparison, an additional support package is needed (used in CAV'2023 submission):
        
    * [Deep Learning Toolbox Verification Library](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/118735-deep-learning-toolbox-verification-library)

    c) To load models from other deep learning frameworks, please install the additional support packages:

    * TensorFlow and Keras: [Deep Learning Toolbox Converter for TensorFlow Models](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64649-deep-learning-toolbox-converter-for-tensorflow-models)
    * PyTorch: [Deep Learning Toolbox Converter for PyTorch Models](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/111925-deep-learning-toolbox-converter-for-pytorch-models)
        
## Uninstallation:

Open MATLAB, then go to the `/code/nnv/` folder and execute the `uninstall.m` script.

# Getting started with NNV 

### [Tutorial](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial)

To get started with NNV, let's take a look at a tutorial containing examples demonstrating:

__NN__

* Robustness verification on the MNIST dataset.
    * [Robustness verification of whole dataset](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NN/MNIST/verify_fc_allTest.m) using a [model with fully-connected and ReLU layers](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NN/MNIST/training_fc.m).
    * [Robustness verification of a single image](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NN/MNIST/verify_fc.m) using a [model with fully-connected and ReLU layers](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NN/MNIST/training_fc.m).
    * [Robustness verification of a single image](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NN/MNIST/verify.m) using a [model with Convolutional, Pooling, Batch Normalization, ReLU, and fully-connected layers](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NN/MNIST/training.m)
* Robustness verification on the GTSRB dataset.
    * Includes [training](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NN/GTSRB/train.m) and [verification](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NN/GTSRB/verify_robust_27.m) scripts as well.
* Comparison of exact (sound and complete) and approximate (sound and incomplete) methods using Star sets [exact vs approx](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NN/randomNN/reach_exact_vs_approx.m)

__NNCS__
  
* Reachability analysis of an [inverted pendulum](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NNCS/InvertedPendulum/reach_invP.m).
* Safety verification example of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system.
    * [Training](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NNCS/ACC/Training%20and%20testing). This requires installing Simulink.
    * [Safety Verification](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NNCS/ACC/Verification/verify.m).
* Safety verification of an Automated Emergency Braking System ([AEBS](code/nnv/examples/Tutorial/NNCS/AEBS))
    * This system contains several neural networks, so a custom control loop is included in the verification script.


### Examples

In addition to the examples from the tutorial, there are more examples in the 'code/nnv/examples/' folder, including:

**Semantic Segmentation**

* [Robustness analysis of semantic segmentation NNs](code/nnv/examples/NN/SemanticSegmentation/M2NIST)

**Recurrent Neural Networks**

* [Robustness analysis of RNNs](code/nnv/examples/NN/RNN)

**Neural Ordinary Differential Equations**

* [Reachability analysis of neural ODEs](code/nnv/examples/NN/NeuralODEs)

And more other [NN](code/nnv/examples/NN) and [NNCS](code/nnv/examples/NNCS) examples.

### Tests

To run all the tests, one can run the following command from 'code/nnv/tests/' folder:

`runtests(pwd, 'IncludeSubfolders', true);`

### Paper Publications and Competitions

All the code for the publication using NNV, including competitions that NNV has participated in (e.g. [VNNCOMP](https://sites.google.com/view/vnn2023) and [ARCH-COMP](https://cps-vo.org/group/ARCH/FriendlyCompetition)) can be found in the [examples/Submissions](code/nnv/examples/Submission) folder. For a selected subset of publications, [tags](https://github.com/verivital/nnv/tags) were created. To reproduce those results, please download NNV using the corresponding tag or use the corresponding CodeOcean capsules.
